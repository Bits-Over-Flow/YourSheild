# U-Sheild - Your Campus Safety & Navigation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

Users (Students): When a dangerous event happens to students, they do not know where to turn because there are too many campus resources available. 

Customer (Universities): Universities have trouble understanding the problems facing their students, because these problems are not being communicated or reported. They therefore are unable to meet the safety needs of their students, and students do not want to stick around. 



## üì± Features

Following are the features available in U-Shield:

1. **:lock: Sign Up/ Log in** : The app allow users to login using Google account
2. :round_pushpin: Location Sharing**: The app allow users to share their location with trusted contacts in real-time, so they can be easily located in case of an emergency.
3. :hourglass: **Time Event Feature**: Allows users to set a timer for a specific duration of time, for example, when they are walking home alone at night. If the timer expires and the user has not deactivated it, an emergency alert will be automatically sent to pre-determined contacts or emergency services. This feature can provide an extra layer of protection for users and peace of mind knowing that they have an automatic safety net in case of an emergency.
